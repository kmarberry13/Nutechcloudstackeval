### About Me

Hello, My Name Is Kim Marberry. I started an Internship eight weeks ago to learn about cloud computing. I went into this endeavor with very little knowledge of actually running and setting up cloud servers. In school we used Azure for our Capstone but did not delve into really what that service was building.

### About the project

When I got to Nutech they put me to work on researching the differences between two main opensource cloud computing services, OpenStack and Cloudstack.
